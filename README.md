# user-overrides
Simple quality of life user-overrides.js files for [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/). 

I've made 4 presets.

All of them:
- Disable credit card and address autofill
- Enable searching from the URL bar
- Upgrade local HTTP to HTTPS
- Enable download verification
- Disable Pocket

suggestions-password makes no further changes.

no-password disables Firefox password saving for use with a third-party password manager.

no-suggestions disables all search bar autofill suggestions.

no-suggestions-no-password disables both of the above.
